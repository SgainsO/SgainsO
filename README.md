## Hi there 👋

My name is Jaskaran Chawla, but you can just call me Jas. From cars to cooking, you will see that I have a wide variety of interests. Professionally, I am interested in Software Engineering and Data Science. I have worked to further both my abilities by creating various personal projects as well as participating in hackathons. I have made many projects, including those that deal with Computer Vision to identify and predict costs of building repairs, Pandas databases, and scikit-learn models to predict information for various tasks, and even a simple [cloud-stored app](https://github.com/SgainsO/CBSapp) to store all your recipes in one place!
### 🏆 Achievements
- [Georgia Tech Hackalytics 2025 Third in Healthcare Track](https://github.com/venkat1596/Hacklytics_Hackathon)
- Florida State University Hack Disaster 2023 Second Overall
### 🌱 I’m Currently learning...
- R
## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
* [Building Damage Assessment](https://github.com/SgainsO/Building-Damage-Assessment)
  * Started off as a hackathon, but me and my team might seek to make it something greater
  * A segmenter model takes satellite data to predict if there are any broken buildings in the picture
    * A YOLO than further analyizes the broken buildings
## Pinned Project Information
### FSU-ASLC-APP
* Developed a mobile app using React Native to inform students about ASLC events.
* Implemented a robust backend with AWS and PostgreSQL to power the app.
* Used tools like figma to propose possible UI designs
### Damage Assesment
* This project was created in a coloboration with Kyiv university students to reduce costs in rebuilding cities
* Used AI models to estimate percent of building damage, and estimate cost to repair
