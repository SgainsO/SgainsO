## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jaskaran Chawla, but you can just call me Jas. From cars to cooking, you will see that I have a wide variety of interests. Professionally, I am interested in Software Engineering and Data Science. I have worked to further both my abilities by creating various personal projects as well as participating in hackathons. I have made many projects, including those that deal with Computer Vision to identify and predict costs of building repairs, Pandas databases, and scikit-learn models to predict information for various tasks, and even a simple cloud-stored app to store all your recipes in one place!
